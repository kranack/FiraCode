Fira Code is a Fira Mono font extended with a set of ligatures for common programming multi-character combinations. This is just a font rendering feature: underlying code remains ASCII-compatible. This helps to read and understand code faster. For some frequent sequences like `..` or `//` ligatures allow us to correct spacing.
